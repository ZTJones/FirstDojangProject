Really?  Planning?






    CODE CASE REVIEW


Ideas:
What magic idea, or workflow, would you like to have?
What parts of ACS do you want to understand better?  Do you want to test video calls? Phone calls?

    Start here:
    ACS User management // Keeping track of user IDs. Probably useful for a mongoDB.
    OAuth, AAD, etc                             
    Calling
    SMS
    Emailing
    PSTN
    Teams Calling Interop



    GraphAPI - Teams meeting generator. Need teams tenant. (Might have one already, should be easy to get)
