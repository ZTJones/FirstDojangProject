Really?  Planning?






    CODE CASE REVIEW


Ideas:
What magic idea, or workflow, would you like to have?
What parts of ACS do you want to understand better?  Do you want to test video calls? Phone calls?

    Start here:
    ACS User management // Keeping track of user IDs. Probably useful for a mongoDB.
    OAuth, AAD, etc                             
    Calling
    SMS
    Emailing
    PSTN
    Teams Calling Interop



    GraphAPI - Teams meeting generator. Need teams tenant. (Might have one already, should be easy to get)



Timeline:

    Week 1:
        Basics, Full Stack explanation/exploration
    Week 2:
        Individual quick starts. Dojang is for review. 
    Week 3:
        "Integrations." UI will be a concern when combining quick starts. 
    Week 4:
        Break time.
    
EXPECTATIONS: (What do we even have at the end of this?)
    A "complete" website, to act as a full stack teaching aid.  Doesn't need any further functionality.
    Stretch goals:
        Chat
        PSTN
        SMS
        And all the other awesome ACS functions.

        HTML 5
        JavaScript
